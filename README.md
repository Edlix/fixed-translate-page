We tried using redux, that was not a fun experience. Existing user works, but adding a new user somehow bugs out. We should have listen to Dewald.

This is the submission for the third assignment in the frontend module of the Noroff Accelerate .NET course.

The goal of the assignment is to build a single page Translation page using React

For this assignment we used the following databases:

https://opentdb.com/api_config.php database for the translations.
https://vue-questionaire.herokuapp.com/translation for the user information
